## Description
Movie Recommendation System project we made as part of our Artificial Intelligence major at ESME.
We used the Educational edition of the Movie Lens public dataset for user ratings and movies.

This contains various user recommendation methods that we discovered throughout the semester and tried to implement *the best we could*!

The results are presented with a website running on a **local** Flask framework.

## Installation :
Find your chosen [Movielens dataset](https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/) or similarly formatted movie rating dataset. 

We chose the full 27m Latest For Education dataset, that we cut ourselves to keep 1 million ratings. Going for the full size might be unstable!

Place the content of the compressed file in the root/Python_files/csv_files/ directory, looking like this : ![image](https://github.com/En-Droide/FlickFinder/assets/85083336/f26b8df6-7815-4217-a63b-7085a738a1c0)

Finally, edit the *project_path* variable at the beginning of the **app.py** file, which is what you should run to start the Flask server.
