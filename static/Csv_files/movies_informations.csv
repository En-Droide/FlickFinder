Ajami (2009),Scandar Copti,"The scene where the cops drive around and someone tries to sell them stolen red shoes, was not staged. They were actually shooting in the car and were interrupted by that man. As the actors used to be actual cops, they reacted like they would, and later the filmmakers decided to keep that scene.","2009, Tous publics, 2h 4m"
Lemon Tree (2008),Eran Riklis,Title Card: [last title card] [after the end credits] Title Card: Lemon tree very pretty and the lemon flower is sweet but the fruit of the poor lemon is impossible to eat.,"2008, Tous publics, 1h 46m"
Cast a Giant Shadow (1966),Melville Shavelson,"Writer, Producer, and Director Melville Shavelson and Kirk Douglas fought throughout the shoot. At one point, Shavelson even walked off the set, leaving his assistant to take over for the day.","1966, Tous publics, 2h 26m"
Oriented (2015),Jake Witzenfeld,"Everything starts out well. Three guys. They identify as gay. They identify as Palestinians. And they say they have Israeli ID cards. They are middle class. But at no time it is revealed what they do. Because the videos that they film are quite far apart and they seem as a play between friends and not jobs.Than we see that only one is fully accepted by his own family, and the others cry a bit, but for the viewer there is not much to relate to the scene unless the viewer is living a similar case.The guys are political. But there are only hints that they do have anything to worry about. Not only that, but they are reluctant to move away from that awful place when given the opportunity. So should I care about the drama queens? Anyway, by half time the novelty is exhausted and the talks, although personal, become the same dilemmas rehashed. By two thirds into the movie I was waiting for the ending. Which does not bring anything. It's like the end of footage, not the end of a documentary.Disappointing.Contact me with Questions, Comments or Suggestions ryitfork @ bitmail.ch","2015, Not Rated, 1h 26m"
